    <p class="one">This is a basketball hoop.</p>
    <p class="spring">I am on the Rhoades School Basketball team. I enjoy playing sports and I like the competitive feeling it gives. It is a good example of me playing on a team with my friends.</p>
    <h2 class="spring">Tennis</h2>
    <img class="spring" src="images/IMG_0207.jpg">
    <p class="one">This is a tennis racket and tennis balls.</p>
    <p class="spring">I also play tennis for fun. As much fun as playing basketball on a team is, I like to play tennis alone. It is good to know that my actions don't affect my teamates, and my teammate's actions don't affect me.</p>
    <h2 class="spring"> Bridge</h2>
    <img class="spring" src="images/IMG_0206.jpg">
    <p class="one"> This is a famous bridge hand.</p>
    <p class="spring">Bridge is a super fun game that I love to play. I like it because it is a thought prevoking game that I can improve on a lot. It is very challenging and it is good for challenging my brain.</p>
